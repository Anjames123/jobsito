Job Portal - Root Redirect Page

This is the main entry point for the Job Portal system that provides
automatic redirection to the actual application folder. Designed to
handle the common scenario where users access the root domain and
need to be redirected to the subfolder containing the main application.

Key Features:
- Automatic redirection using meta refresh tag
- Visual loading indicator with professional design
- Fallback JavaScript redirect for reliability
- User-friendly interface with manual redirect option
- Responsive design with modern styling
- Professional loading animation and branding

Redirect Methods Used:
1. Meta refresh (primary): HTML-based automatic redirect after page load
2. JavaScript timeout (backup): Ensures redirect even if meta refresh fails
3. Manual link (failsafe): Provides user-controlled redirect option

Design Features:
- Modern gradient background for professional appearance
- Glassmorphism design with backdrop filter effects
- Loading spinner animation for visual feedback
- Clear messaging explaining the redirect process
- Accessible color contrast and typography
- Mobile-responsive layout design

Technical Implementation:
- Uses modern CSS features (backdrop-filter, flexbox, animations)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Cross-browser compatible redirect methods
- No external dependencies for fast loading
- Semantic HTML structure for accessibility
